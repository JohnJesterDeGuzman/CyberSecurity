			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYour organization will need to go through an IT Transformation by being proactive and vigilant. 
			Here are five different cyber security strategies you need to implement in order to keep your business safe 
			and secure.</p>
			<p><i><strong><li>Create a security system:</li></strong></i><br>Unlike traditional administrative structures where operations 
			and enforcement of rules are handled from the top-down, creating a security system using your 
			human capital will need to be organized from the bottom-up. This security system to protect your 
			enterprise starts by securing devices your employees use in your business. Work on creating a culture 
			of accountability so everyone will communicate with systems don’t seem to being working as intended.</p>
			<p><i><strong><li>Increase your employee skillset:</li></strong></i><br>Your cybersecurity is only as strong as its weakest link. 
			Regularly train your team on the latest IT best practices. Help them understand that their 
			efforts are critical to protecting company assets and that it’s in their best interest to 
			increase their IT knowledge base regardless of whether they’re a software developer or a marketing 
			specialist. While it may be expensive upfront, paying for coding boot camps for your employees is a 
			worthwhile investment.</p>
			<p><i><strong><li>Backup your data:</li></strong></i><br>Just like the best YouTubers constantly create backups of video 
			footage they record, you need to constantly backup your organization’s data. Always backup your data, 
			files and any electronic information that is vital to your business as well as the most recent 
			drafts/iterations of projects your team is working on.</p>
			<p><i><strong><li>Put the cloud to work:</li></strong></i><br>Although the cloud still has its risks, you are less likely to 
			lose critical data by saving data to the cloud. Using the cloud for data storage is an economical 
			option for small to mid-sized businesses. As smaller businesses scale and grow as result of increased 
			sales, cloud storage and cloud security tools can scale with the business.</p><font size="3"><a href = "featuresandcontent.html">FEATURES AND CONTENT ON MY VIDEO.</a></font>
