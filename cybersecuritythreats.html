						<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The process of keeping up with new technologies, security trends and threat intelligence 
						is a challenging task. It is necessary in order to protect information and other assets from 
						cyberthreats, which take many forms. Types of cyberthreats include:</p>
						<p><i><strong><li>Malware</li></strong></i> is a form of malicious software in which any file or program can be used to harm a computer user. 
						This includes worms, viruses, Trojans and spyware.</p>
						<p><i><strong><li>Ransomware</li></strong></i> is another type of malware. It involves an attacker locking the victim's computer system files 
						-- typically through encryption -- and demanding a payment to decrypt and unlock them.
						<p><i><strong><li>Social engineering</li></strong></i> is an attack that relies on human interaction to trick users into breaking 
						security procedures 
						to gain sensitive information that is typically protected.</p>
						<p><i><strong><li>Phishing</li></strong></i> is a form of social engineering where fraudulent email or text messages that resemble 
						those from reputable or known sources are sent. Often random attacks, the intent of these messages
						is to steal sensitive data, such as credit card or login information.</p>
						<p><i><strong><li>Spear phishing</li></strong></i> is a type of phishing attack that has an intended target user, organization or business.</p>
						<p><i><strong><li>Insider threats</li></strong></i> are security breaches or losses caused by humans -- for example, employees, contractors or customers. 
						Insider threats can be malicious or negligent in nature.</p>
						<p><i><strong><li>Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks</li></strong></i> are those in which multiple systems disrupt the traffic of 
						a targeted system, such as a server, website or other network resource. By flooding the target with messages, 
						connection requests or packets, the attackers can slow the system or crash it, preventing legitimate traffic 
						from using it.</p>
						<p><i><strong><li>Advanced persistent threats (APTs)</li></strong></i> are prolonged targeted attacks in which an attacker infiltrates a 
						network and remains undetected for long periods of time with the aim to steal data.</p>
						<p><i><strong><li>Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks</li></strong></i> are eavesdropping attacks that involve an attacker intercepting and 
						relaying messages between two parties who believe they are communicating with each other.</p>
						<p>Other common attacks include botnets, drive-by-download attacks, exploit kits, malvertising, vishing, 
						credential stuffing attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, SQL injection attacks, business email 
						compromise (BEC) and zero-day exploits.</p><font size="3"><a href = "cybersecuritymanagementstrategies.html">CYBERSECURITY MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES.</a></font>
