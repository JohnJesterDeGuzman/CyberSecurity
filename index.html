						&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems such as hardware,
						software and data from cyberthreats. The practice is used by individuals and enterprises
						to protect against unauthorized access to data centers and other computerized systems.
					</p>

					<p>
						&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA strong cybersecurity strategy can provide a good security posture against
						malicious attacks designed to access, alter, delete, destroy or extort an organization's
						or user's systems and sensitive data. Cybersecurity is also instrumental in preventing attacks
						that aim to disable or disrupt a system's or device's operations.

						&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMaintaining cybersecurity in a constantly evolving threat landscape is a challenge
						for all organizations. Traditional reactive approaches, in which resources were put toward
						protecting systems against the biggest known threats, while lesser known threats were undefended,
						is no longer a sufficient tactic. To keep up with changing security risks, a more proactive and
						adaptive approach is necessary. Several key cybersecurity advisory organizations offer guidance.
						For example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends adopting
						continuous monitoring and real-time assessments as part of a risk assessment framework to defend
						against threats.<br><font size="3"><a href = "cybersecuritythreats.html">THREATS IN CYBERSECURITY.</a></font>
